# Troubleshooting

Common issues and solutions users might run into while using PhyloNext.

!!! bug "Don't see your error/bug? Post an issue on GitHub"
    If you've encountered an error or bug not seen here, please post an issue at [PhyloNext GitHub Issues](https://github.com/vmikk/PhyloNext/issues). This will help greatly to track down the error and fix it!

## Pipeline errors

### Resume the workflow

!!! failure "Pipeline was interrupted"
    Any accidental failure - e.g., you closed the terminal, rebooted your computer, or the task was killed by a scheduler on HPC.

If the pipeline is interrupted, it can be resumed without having to start from scratch.  
Add the `-resume` flag to your command, and Nextflow will start the workflow from the last successfully executed process, 
retrieving all previous results from the cache.



### The number of available CPUs

!!! failure "Number of CPUs required"
    `Process requirement exceeds available CPUs -- req: 10; avail: 8`

Most likely, the number of CPUs configured for a process is larger than available on your system. 
To fix it, modify a config file and reduce the number of CPUs for workflow processes to fit your hardware. E.g., change
``` java
    withName:occ_filter{
        cpus = 10
    }
```
to 
``` java
    withName:occ_filter{
        cpus = 8
    }
```

See the `Configuration` section in the [usage documentation](https://phylonext.github.io/usage/#configuration-file).

### Pipeline revision version

!!! failure "Pipeline revision version"
    ```
    Project \`vmikk/phylonext\` is currently stickied on revision: main -- you need to explicitly specify a revision with the option \`-r\` in order to use it
    ```

Solution - specify a version number of the pipeline.  
To run the latest version, add `-r main` to your command.  
Alternatively, you may specify the exact version (or tag) you wish, e.g. `-r v.0.0.2`.  

## Installation problems

### Nextflow not found

!!! failure "Command not found"
    `command not found: nextflow`

If you installed Nextflow in the `~/bin` directory, most likely, it is not added to your PATH environment variable. 
To fix it, run the following command:

``` bash
export PATH="$HOME/bin:$PATH"
```
and try to execute Nextflow again.  

If it works, you may add this command to the `~/.bashrc` file to make these changes permanent. 
To do it from the command line, run:  

``` bash
echo "export PATH=$HOME/bin:$PATH" >> ~/.bashrc
```

!!! example "Notes on shells other than bash"
    If you are using a shell other than `bash`, please modify configuration file specific for your shell.  
    E.g., for `zsh` it should be `~/.zshrc`.  
    To know which shell are you using, run `echo $SHELL`

### GitHub API rate limits

!!! failure "GitHub API rate limits"
    ```
    Checking vmikk/PhyloNext ...  
    WARN: Cannot read project manifest -- Cause: API rate limit exceeded -- Provide your GitHub user name and password to get a higher rate limit  
    API rate limit exceeded -- Provide your GitHub user name and password to get a higher rate limit
    ```

Without authentication, GitHub allows only a limited number of connections per hour (60 unauthenticated requests/hr). 
Most likely, you've hit this problem because users from your organization (e.g., university) send too many requests to GitHub.  

To overcome this limitation, you may generate a personal access token at [https://github.com/settings/tokens](https://github.com/settings/tokens)  
Then, temporarily configure git to use your token with:
``` bash
username="YOUR_USERNAME"
access_token="YOUR_TOKEN"
git config --global url."https://${username}:${access_token}@github.com".insteadOf "https://github.com"
```
before running `nextflow pull vmikk/phylonext`.  

Alternatively, you may wait for a while until the recovery of API limits. 
Or, if you are using PhyloNext locally, you may change your IP address 
(for example, connect your laptop to another wi-fi hotspot, e.g., to a smartphone hotspot) 
and try to pull the pipeline once again. 
You need to download the pipeline from GitHub only once. 
Then, Nextflow will cache the pipeline code locally in the `~/.nextflow/assets/` directory 
and will re-use it later without the need to connect to GitHub.  

As another option, you may install GitHub client `gh` ([https://cli.github.com/](https://cli.github.com/)) 
and run `gh auth login` to login and have a higher API rate limit.

!!! example "Rate limit information"
    To find the current rate limit information, run  
    `curl -I https://api.github.com/users/octocat`

!!! warning "Token security"
    It is important to keep your token secure and not share it with others.  
    Also make sure to revoke the token if it is compromised or no longer needed.

### Docker permissions

!!! failure "Docker - permission denied"
    `docker: Got permission denied while trying to connect to the Docker daemon socket at unix:///var/run/docker.sock: Post "http://%2Fvar%2Frun%2Fdocker.sock/v1.24/containers/create?name=nxf-Cz6yqNjGI9AhRpsqkU4mSAHC": dial unix /var/run/docker.sock: connect: permission denied.`

Most likely, you forgot to add your user to the `docker` group and you need a super-user privileges to execute the container.  
To fix this error, run:  

``` bash
# Create the docker group.
sudo groupadd docker

#  Add your user to the docker group.
sudo usermod -aG docker ${USER}

# Log out and log back in so that your group membership is re-evaluated.
# Alternatively, to skip logging out, type the following command:  su -s ${USER}

# Verify that you can run docker commands without sudo
docker run hello-world
```

### Docker and WSL2

!!! failure "Docker and WSL2"
    `The command 'docker' could not be found in this WSL 2 distro. We recommend to activate the WSL integration in Docker Desktop settings.`

Try to enable `Use the WSL2 based engine` in the `Docker Desktop` settings.

### PhyloNext containers

If for some reason Nextflow is not able to download containers for PhyloNext, 
it's possible to pull them manually using:

``` bash
docker pull vmikk/rarrow:1.0.0
docker pull vmikk/biodiverse:1.0.0
docker pull vmikk/opentree:0.0.2
```
